CloudFiles Uploader
===================

I've recently been transferring a lot of my sites and server-based services
over to RackspaceCloud, and part of this meant uploading a fairly large number
of files to the CloudFiles service. The web interface sucks for more than a
few files so I knocked up this quick script to make it easier.

Requirements
============

* Python (tested on 2.5.2, will probably work with earlier versions)
* https://github.com/rackspace/python-cloudfiles

Usage
=====

Usage: cloudfiles_uploader.py [OPTION]... FILE...
Uploads the specified files to a Rackspace CloudFiles account. The container
will be created if necessary, and existing files will be overwritten.

  -u, --username    your RackspaceCloud API username
  -k, --key         your RackspaceCloud API key
  -c, --container   the destination container name
  -s, --servicenet  set this if you're running in a CloudServer so it will use
                    the local network
  -d, --datacentre  specifies which data centre you're in, "us" or "uk"
                    if ommitted then "us" will be tried first then "uk"
  -q, --quiet       suppress all output except error messages

The username, key and container options are required.
